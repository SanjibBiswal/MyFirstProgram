Hey I am going to explain you how to write your first program in java.
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is the main method, where the program starts execution.
        // It's a special method that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for when running a Java program.
        
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        // This line prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console.
        // System.out is a predefined class that represents the standard output (usually the console).
        // The println method is used to print a line of text, and it adds a newline character after the text.

        // Your Java code can include more statements and logic beyond this point.
    }
}
public class HelloWorld: In Java, programs are organized into classes. This line defines a class named "HelloWorld." The class name must match the filename (in this case, it should be in a file named "HelloWorld.java").

{: The opening curly brace marks the beginning of the class definition. Everything between the opening and closing braces defines the class.

public static void main(String[] args) {: This line declares the main method. The public keyword means that the method can be accessed from outside the class. The static keyword means that this method belongs to the class itself (not to an instance of the class). void indicates that the method doesn't return any value. main is the method name, and it is the entry point of the program. String[] args is a parameter that can be passed to the program, although we're not using it in this simple example.

System.out.println("Hello, World!");: This is the actual code that gets executed. It uses the System.out object (representing the standard output, typically the console) and the println method to print "Hello, World!" followed by a newline character. The double quotes "Hello, World!" enclose the text to be printed.

}: The closing curly brace marks the end of the main method.

}: The closing curly brace marks the end of the HelloWorld class definition.

In summary, this "Hello, World!" program demonstrates the basic structure of a Java program, defining a class and a main method. The main method is the entry point, and it prints the greeting message to the console. You can expand upon this foundation to create more complex Java programs.
